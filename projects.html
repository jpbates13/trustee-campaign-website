                I was one of fifteen UMass Boston students selected to
                participate in Google J-Term, a course in Android app
                development, at Google's Cambridge offices. My final project was
                team-built Android app that displayed nearby social events one
                at a time. The user could swipe right and indicate interest in
                the event or swipe left to reject it.

                A constantly maintained personal website that serves as a
                directory of my resume, personal projects, as well as other
                relevant documents. Previously this website has used WordPress
                but now it is hosted via Github Pages with a custom layout I
                created, using Jekyll as a templating engine.

                This is a python/flask app I use to see when busses are arriving near my apartment using the MBTA API. I run it on a raspberry pi, making it accessible to everyone on my apartment's network so that my roommates can also see when busses are arriving.

                This was a small raspberry pi project I created for a hackathon
                I participated in my junior year in high school. The raspbery pi
                hosted a web server (written in a microframework for Python
                called Flask) that accepted input from the user and then
                displayed the message on an LED in morse code.

                This is a command line version of the card game Black Jack
                written in Java. This project served as my final project for an
                Advanced Placement computer science I took in high school.
