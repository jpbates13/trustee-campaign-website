    <div class="experience contentPiece"><p>I have been proud to serve on student government for three years. My freshman year, I served on the Student Events and Organizations Committee and for the last two years  I served on the Budget and Finance Committee. I was elected to serve as chair of the Budget and Finance committee for this academic year. In my time as chair we have discovered numerous opportunities to save money on operating costs (such as office supplies and printing expenses) so that more is invested in the programs that students enjoy.</p>
      <p>In addition to my committee experience, for the last two years I have served on the Faculty Council as the Student representative. In my time on the council I have had input on decisions regarding a wide range of topics from the sale of Bayside, to student employees’ compensation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most notably, I wrote and advocated for a motion that was unanimously passed by the council, resulting in the enhanced Pass/Fail  and withdrawal policies for our remote semesters. </p></div>
    <div class="platform contentPiece"><p>As your Student Trustee my primary goal is to be the student body’s greatest advocate. While being a voice for students is a crucial part of the Trustee role I also believe the best leaders are most often the best listeners. I hope to lead by that standard and hear out any ideas that come my way and understand all sides of any issue. </p>

      <p>There are a bunch of initiatives I am excited about bringing to the Board of Trustees. Here are just a few:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Making sure the transition back to campus is handled efficiently and safely at both a system and university level with as much student input as possible.</li>
      <li>Continuing to urge more faculty to adopt Open Education Resources (OER are educational materials—everything from a single lesson plan to an entire textbook—that save students and teachers money because they are free to use, customize, and share)</li>
      <li>Advocating for the Fight for Five; an initiative to give all five student trustees the ability to cast a vote on the UMass Board of Trustees.</li>
      </ul>
